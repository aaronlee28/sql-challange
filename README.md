# sql-challange
This project is from the perspective of a newly hired data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. The first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. 

The goal is to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer several questions about the data. 

There are three parts to the project. The first part is Data Modeling, where an ERD of the tables is sketched out based on the CSV files using a tool from www.quickdatabasediagrams.com. 

The second part of the project is Data Engineering. The goal is to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, where each data type is specified, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Each CSV files are then imported to their designated table, in order to perform the final part of the project. 

The third part of the project is Data Analysis. The objective is to answer different questions regarding the employees using different tables by performing joins and filters.
